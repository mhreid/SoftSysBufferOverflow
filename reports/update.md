# Buffer Overflow Attack Project Update
#### Sabrina Pereira and Micah Reid


## Project Goals
Our goal is to understand the mechanics of buffer overflow attacks, and common issues that would make a program susceptible to this type of security risk. Our minimum goal is to go through the provided exercises to perform buffer overflow attacks (provided by Steve) and create a document detailing our learnings and how we went about the attacks, including our understandings of how the attacks work and the debugging tools we learned to make it happen. Our reach goals are to understand buffer overflow attacks enough to create our own programs that either have exploitable vulnerabilities, or use practices to prevent buffer overflow attacks.


## Learning Goals
We hope to gain experience using a debugger as this will allow us to gain more insight into how these attacks are performed, and what is actually happening in the memory. We hope to answer questions such as:
  - How does the data get copied into the buffer?
  - What types of programs are susceptible to this type of attack?
  - How would one go about performing this type of attack?
  - How do we know if our programs would be vulnerable?


## Project Resources
We have been using the CLion debugger and looked at a few tutorials to get us acquainted with the environment, and have been provided with sample code that has relevant vulnerabilities. We have identified some resources to help us understand this attack, especially this [Computerphile video on Buffer Overflow Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S0aBV-Waeo).


## Current Tasks
1. Reproduce attack for the [example buffer overflow problem](https://github.com/syclops/buffer-overflow-examples)) loading the unintended software, and document for the final report, Micah
  - Definition of done: completed section in the final report detailing our approach to this attack
2. Reproduce attack for the [example buffer overflow problem](https://github.com/syclops/buffer-overflow-examples)) and executing shell code, and document for the final report, Sabrina
  - Definition of done: completed section in the final report detailing our approach to this attack
3. Finishing final report relevant/background information with all that we have learned from performing these buffer overflow attacks, Sabrina
  - Definition of done: finished report sections with information on overview on what buffer overflow attacks are, as well as relevant debugger information
