# Buffer Overflow Attack Project Proposal
#### Sabrina Pereira and Micah Reid


## Project Goals
Our goal is to understand the mechanics of buffer overflow attacks, and common issues that would make a program susceptible to this type of security risk. Our minimum goal is to go through the provided exercises to perform buffer overflow attacks (provided by Steve). Our reach goals are to understand buffer overflow attacks enough to create our own programs that either have exploitable vulnerabilities, or use practices to prevent buffer overflow attacks.


## Learning Goals
We hope to gain experience using a debugger as this will allow us to gain more insight into how these attacks are performed, and what is actually happening in the memory. We hope to answer questions such as:
  - How does the data get copied into the buffer?
  - What types of programs are susceptible to this type of attack?
  - How would one go about performing this type of attack?
  - How can we make sure that out programs are not vulnerable?


## Resources Needed
We have already decided which debugger we would like to use for this project (CLion), but we would love to be provided with some sample code that has relevant vulnerabilities. We also have resources provided by Steve for learning more about buffer overflow attacks and potentially some competition-style programming problems related to this subject. We would like access to the practice problems Steve told us about.


## First Steps
1. Install the IDE with debugger (CLion) and look into how to use it, Micah and Sabrina
  - Definition of done: able to run programs with breakpoints, view relevant data/variables
2. Look at the set of 6 programs that Steve has on this topic, Micah and Sabrina
  - Definition of done: understand core concepts of each program, be able to verbally explain vulnerabilities
3. Learn how things get copied into the buffer - analyze with debugger
  - Definition of done: Look at resources (links in Trello, ones from Steve) and understand what the problem really is. Then use debugger to track the steps of data getting copied into buffers of 1-3 different types.
